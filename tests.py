# input: n-element descending random sequence provided by the generator, output: time
# time should be measured on: 1) structure creation 2) searching for the min. value 3) in-order printing
# for BST time should also be measured on 4) BST balancing
# testing: one point on a plot is an avg of 10 samples
# plot should have at least 10 values of n, SD should also be provided
